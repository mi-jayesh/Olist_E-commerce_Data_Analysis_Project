## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project was to perform an end-to-end data analysis on over 100,000+ transactions from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace, to:

- Understand customer behavior, purchasing trends, and operational efficiency by analyzing KPIs such as Average Order Value (AOV), customer retention, profit margins, and delivery performance.

- Identify growth opportunities across product categories, payment methods, and fulfillment processes to drive data-informed business decisions.
- Based on the insights derived, the project  aimed to recommend actionable strategies to improve customer retention, optimize inventory for high-margin products, and enhance delivery performance—ultimately contributing to increased profitability and customer satisfaction.
