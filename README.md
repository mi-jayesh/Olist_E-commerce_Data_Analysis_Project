This project focuses on analyzing the performance and operational efficiency of Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. By leveraging data on customer behavior, product categories, payment methods, delivery performance, and customer reviews, the analysis provides actionable insights to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth.

Key areas of exploration include Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), repeat purchase rates, profit margins, delivery efficiency, and customer feedback. The findings are supported by data-driven recommendations to enhance inventory management, logistics, and customer retention strategies.

**Key Highlights:**

In addition to the detailed data analysis, I created an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to help stakeholders track and monitor key business metrics. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Olist's performance, enabling stakeholders to:

* Track Total Orders, Total Customers, and Total Revenue in real time.
* Analyze Orders by Order Status, identifying patterns in cancellations, late deliveries, and completed orders.
* Visualize Revenue Trends over time and by states or regions.
* Gain insights into Revenue by Product Categories, highlighting which categories drive the most sales.
* Leverage Year and Quarter filters to perform dynamic, time-specific analysis for better decision-making.
* This dashboard allows stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions and align strategies with performance trends across various dimensions.
* This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in driving business decisions and improving e-commerce performance.
