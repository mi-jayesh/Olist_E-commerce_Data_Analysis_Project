**Objectives :-** 
---
Key areas of exploration include Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), repeat purchase rates, profit margins, delivery efficiency, and customer feedback. The findings are supported by data-driven recommendations to enhance inventory management, logistics, and customer retention strategies.

**Analysis Workflow :-**  
---
* **Cleaning:** Data preparation and preprocessing to ensure high-quality data for analysis.
* **Analysis:** Extracting insights using Python and SQL, focusing on key metrics like AOV, CLV, and delivery performance.
* **Dashboarding:** Creating an interactive Tableau dashboard for visualizing and presenting the findings to stakeholders.

**Key Highlights :-**
---
* Identified high-value product categories and payment preferences.

* Analyzed delivery performance and late delivery trends.

* Provided strategies to increase repeat purchases and customer loyalty.

* Recommended improvements for inventory management and operational efficiency.

In addition to the detailed data analysis, I created an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to help stakeholders track and monitor key business metrics.  
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Olist's performance, enabling stakeholders to:

* Track Total Orders, Total Customers, and Total Revenue in real time.
* Analyze Orders by Order Status, identifying patterns in cancellations, late deliveries, and completed orders.
* Visualize Revenue Trends over time and by states or regions.
* Gain insights into Revenue by Product Categories, highlighting which categories drive the most sales.
* Leverage Year and Quarter filters to perform dynamic, time-specific analysis for better decision-making.
* This dashboard allows stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions and align strategies with performance trends across various dimensions.
* This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in driving business decisions and improving e-commerce performance.
